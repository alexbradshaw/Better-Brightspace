# How to run

## Prerequisites:

- Node Package Manager (comes with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) when it's installed)
- Docker ([Install link](https://www.docker.com/))

### Once you have npm and docker, you need to install the necessary dependencies via the `npm install` command

### To start the application, run `npm run build` which will build the final version in a docker container

### Once it's done, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

For your convenience, it's already deployed at [deployed link](https://better-brightspace-256619215082.us-east1.run.app/)
