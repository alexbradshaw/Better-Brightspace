# How to run

## Prerequisites:

- Node Package Manager (comes with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) when it's installed)
- Docker ([Install link](https://www.docker.com/))

## How to run

### Once you have npm and docker, you can start the application via the `npm run build` command, which will build the final version in a docker container

### Once it's done, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployed Link

For your convenience, it's already deployed at [deployed link](https://better-brightspace-256619215082.us-east1.run.app/)

## Frameworks / Limitations

The application is written in TypeScript- built using the Svelte/SvelteKit framework and a PostgreSQL database. 

The final application is pretty versatile as it is containerized, meaning that it should run on most systems. 

Svelte is also super fast so it allows for a beautiful final product with minimal performance drawbacks.
